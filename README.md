## What To Find Here

In Next.js images have been giving me silly problems. I made this out from a tutorial on youtube that I link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zDb1kh52nM&t=1028s)

- Load static and dynamic images using the Image properties "placeholder" and "blurDataURL".
- Used "fs" to get the buffer for plaiceholder (for static images)
- Plaiceholder, getPlaiceholder (base64, color) - used for the first time. Magic experience.
- Custom in-view with opacity and Custom Slide with "react-intersection-observer".
